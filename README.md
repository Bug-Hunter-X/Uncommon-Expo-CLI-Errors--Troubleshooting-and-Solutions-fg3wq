# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors: Troubleshooting and Solutions

This repository demonstrates troubleshooting and solutions for uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI.  These errors often relate to SDK version mismatches, missing dependencies, or problems with the project's configuration.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Create a new Expo project (if you prefer, start with a problematic project):
   ```bash
expo init my-expo-project
cd my-expo-project
```
2. Modify or corrupt the package.json file (intentionally introduce errors to mimic real-world scenarios). For example, remove a dependency, introduce a typo in a dependency name, or use an incorrect version.
3. Run the project:
   ```bash
expo start
```
4. Observe the error messages.

## Solutions

The solutions provided in the `expoBugSolution.js` file address typical causes like SDK mismatches, missing or incorrect dependencies, and environment inconsistencies.  The approaches involve carefully checking and adjusting the `package.json` file, verifying dependencies, and making sure your environment is properly configured for Expo.
