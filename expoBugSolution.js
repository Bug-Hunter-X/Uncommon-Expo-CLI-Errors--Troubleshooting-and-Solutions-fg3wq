// Solution 1: Check SDK Version and Dependencies
const packageJson = require('./package.json');
console.log('Current project dependencies:', packageJson.dependencies);

// Check if Expo SDK version is compatible with the project dependencies
// Check your expo.json file to ensure that the SDK version matches.
// If a dependency is outdated or missing, update or install it.   
npm install --save <missing_dependency>

// Solution 2: Clean the cache and reinstall node modules

npm cache clean --force
npm install

//Solution 3: Check your system environment
//Ensure that you are using a supported version of Node.js and npm.
//Check your PATH and make sure that it is configured correctly to include Node.js and npm. 
//Try restarting your terminal after making changes to the environment variables.

// Solution 4:  Check the expo.json file for any syntax errors.
// Ensure the file is well-formed JSON. Syntax errors will likely cause failures during startup. 

//Solution 5: If you're still encountering issues:
//Delete the node_modules folder and reinstall the dependencies.  This can help to clear out any potentially corrupt or incomplete installations.

//Sometimes, a combination of these steps is needed to resolve the issue.
